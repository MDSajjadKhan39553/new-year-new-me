                    Pretend you work for a fashion magazine.It’s already a given that you and your coworkers will consider the office their runway, right?Everyone has different reasons for the way they dress.Some choose their outfits based on their level of confidence and mood, while others dress to the nines to impress peers or be a trendsetter.Those who dressed up for personal reasons are known to have intrinsic motivation.Those who base their outfits on societal or peer pressure are examples of people with extrinsic motivation.What are these types of motivation, and why are they important?Difference Between Extrinsic and Intrinsic Motivation“We are happy when for everything inside us there is a corresponding something outside us.” – William Butler Yeats</p>

                    <h4 class="title">Don’t wait for Perfection</h4>
                    <p class="article">When we have dreams,  we have a passion. When we have a passion, we want to do it with perfection. Often, when we have some goals, we want to start it with a blast. We want to become an overnight star. We want to achieve best as soon as possible. But things take time. It gets better with the time, but the key is to start as soon as possible.What happens  is that we have an idea, which we think can change our or someone’s life instantly. But we don’t work on it until we have favorable situations. We wait for more time and more resources. And, one day someone else built a product on that idea and we regret.We have heard this statement, “Ohh I also had the same idea, but could not start.”</p>
